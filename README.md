# World_Weather_Analysis
There are 4 parts to this analysis:
1) Part 1 involved creating 1500 random generated numbers and using them to generate geographic coordinate pairs. we then used those pairs to find the nearest cities. In addition, we used OpenAPIWeather site to then get weather data on each city. 
2) Using this weather data, we assisted students with scatter plots to look for correlations between coordinates and various weather parameters such as temperture, humidity, rainfall etc. 
3) Next we used our city database to generate Google heatmaps according to different weather attributes, and to narrow our search according to input on temperature from vacationers. 
4) And last, we narrowed city search parameters further with vacationer input, and generated a Google Directions map between 4 chosen cities and showed popup markers on the map for Hotels and Weather Description.
